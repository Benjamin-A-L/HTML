    <i>What is HTML?</i> <br />
    <p>
      <b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup language
      for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
      assisted by technologies such as <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> and
      scripting languages such as <b>JavaScript.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers receive <b>HTML</b> documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page <i>semantically</i> and originally included
      cues for the appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>HTML</b> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
      constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
      embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
      structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
      headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
      are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
      &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page.
      Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about
      document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
      display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
