            Maxwell Maltz (March 10, 1899 – April 7, 1975[1]) was an American
            cosmetic surgeon and author of Psycho-Cybernetics (1960), which was
            a system of ideas that he claimed could improve one's self-image
            leading to a more successful and fulfilling life.[2] He wrote
            several books, among which Psycho-Cybernetics was a long-time
            bestseller — influencing many subsequent self-help
            teachers.[3][4][5] His orientation towards a system of ideas that
            would provide self-help is considered the forerunner of the now
            popular self-help books.[6] Life and career Maxwell "Max" Maltz was
            born March 10, 1899, in Manhattan's Lower East Side, the third child
            of Josef Maltz and Taube Elzweig,[7] both Jewish immigrants from
            what was then known as the town of Resche in the Austro-Hungarian
            Empire (today Rzeszów, Poland).[8] In 1923, Maltz graduated with a
            doctorate in medicine from the Columbia University College of
            Physicians and Surgeons. He also undertook training under German
            plastic surgeons who were considered most advanced in cosmetic
            surgery at that time.[1] In 1960, Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Way to
            Get More Living out of Life was first published by Prentice-Hall and
            appeared in a pocket book edition by 1969. The book introduced
            Maltz's views that people must have an accurate and positive view of
            themselves before setting goals; otherwise they will get stuck in a
            continuing pattern of limiting beliefs. His ideas focus on
            visualizing one's goals and he believed that self-image is the
            cornerstone of all the changes that take place in a person.
            According to Maltz, if one's self-image is unhealthy or faulty — all
            of a person's efforts will end in failure.[2] Maltz also wrote
            fiction, including a play called Unseen Scar (1946)[9] and a novel,
            The Time is Now (1975).[10] His autobiography, Doctor Pygmalion: The
            Autobiography of a Plastic Surgeon (1953),[11] was popular and
            influential,[12] being discussed in many subsequent books on body
            and identity.[13] It was re-titled Doctor Psycho-Cybernetics after
            his self-help work was published. Although the book
            Psycho-Cybernetics was first published in 1960, as of 2008 the book
            is one of 50 recommended in the book 50 Self-Help Classics.
